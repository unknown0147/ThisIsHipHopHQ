# ThisIsHipHopHQ
We are ThisIsHipHopHQ, founded in 2017 by RealTusoul as a platform to showcase Hip Hop artists. With so many Hip hop artists and little platform willing to promote their works due to cash constraint etc. We aim at bridging the gap between artists and their audience through profiling, music blogging and hype. This great platform was started by RealTusoul in 2017 when he was fed up with contacting music blogs but getting no reply from bloggers. Be a part of the Hip Hop movement and get involved. This Is the HQ and We are Hip Hop.
